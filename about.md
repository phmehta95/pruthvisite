Hi, I'm Pruthvi, an MSc Particle Physics student at QMUL. This is a site devoted to cataloguing  my pursuit of knoweldge in this field, ranging from topics I'm interested in to how my MSc and possible PhD is going, and what I learn while doing them. I feel like me doing this will reinforce what I learn and perhaps help others who are interested in learning about what I am. This site will also feature info about particle physics related extra-curricular things I attend e.g conferences/talks e.t.c in order to spread awareness about them and perhaps get more people interested in going to them. Hope you enjoy!

Pruthvi
