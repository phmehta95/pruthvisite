  <p>EDUCATION</p>

<p>Queen Mary University of London                                                  2014-present</p>

<p>BSc. (Hons.)  Physics- First  Class degree obtained  (71%)</p>

<p>My final year Extended Independent Project  involved  me analysing  simulation  data from Hyper-Kamiokande using software packages WCSim and Geant4.  I compared  how the  data  involving the  photomultiplier tubes  changed  depending  on which of the  three models for hadronic  interactions (BINARY,  BERTINI and GHEISHA)  was used. I also used a program  called Prob 3++ to investigate CP violation due to neutrino  oscillations. This project  has given me an understanding of how to program  using UNIX and how to use the data  analysis framework ROOT,  and has reinforced  my knowledge of C++.</p>

<p>The third  year module Radiation Detectors  involved learning  about  how the compo- nents  used in particle  physics detectors  work, for example PMTs,  scintillation counters and  semiconductor detectors. I achieved  79% in this  module.  The  Elementary Particle Physics module in which I achieved 70% involved learning about a broad range of particle physics topics in detail  including the Higgs field, CP Violation,  neutrino  oscillation and electroweak symmetry  breaking.  The module Statistical Data  Analysis involved learning about  different distributions such  as Binomial  and  Poisson,  as well as topics  such  as probability, confidence intervals,  limits,  hypothesis  testing  and multivariate analysis.  It reinforced  my knowledge of R and  how to use scripts  for neural  networks  and  support vector machines.</p>

<p>In the second year module Quantum Mechanics A I achieved 86% overall which shows my understanding of the  key principles  of quantum mechanics  applied  to systems  such as finite and infinite quantum wells, simple harmonic  oscillators  and potential barriers, quantum tunnelling  and the solution  to the hydrogen  atom.</p>

<p>In the  first  year  I also undertook an  optional  module  called “Introduction to  C++ programming” in which I was taught how to write simple programs  in C++, which in- cluded the use of loops, functions,  classes, vectors, pointers  and reference, and I achieved
72% overall in this module.</p>

<p>Northwood College                                                                          1998-2014</p>

<p>Qualifications:</p>

<p>A-Levels:    Mathematics-A, English Literature-A, Physics-B,  Further Maths-B</p>

<p>GCSEs: 	13 GCSEs, 10 A<em>s, 3As, including A</em> in Maths,  Physics,  Statistics, Chemistry  and English Literature</p>

<p>WORK EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>Invited  to attend and help organise BUSSTEPP 2017 (British  Universities  Summer School in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics).  (August  2017) This will hopefully enrich my knowledge of particle  physics and improve my organisational and communication  skills.</p>

<p>Attended CAPS  2017 (Conference  of Astronomy  and Physics  Students 2017) where I was asked to give a talk  and present a poster  on my final year research  project.  This boosted  my confidence with regards  to presenting  my research  and allowed me to learn about  the research  fellow students did at other  universities.</p>

<p>I also undertook a day’s work experience at University  College Hospital  (July  2013). I learned  about  the realm of medical physics, in particular, radiotherapy. This gave me insight into how physics is used in the medical field to benefit the lives of others.</p>

<p>Invited  to CERN  for the “Researchers’  Night”  event (August  2012). The group I was in looked at ATLAS. We used a program  called CAMILLA to try  and spot a possible Higgs Boson being produced  by studying  the tracks  left by previous collisions. This
was important because it gave me a glimpse of the actual  software used by scientists  at
CERN.  Pictures of the event can be found here: http://cds.cern.ch/record/1482106</p>

<p>I underwent a week’s work experience at King’s College London (July  2012). At the end of the week I was to present a chosen physics topic to physics students and members of the physics department. My group’s chosen topic was the Higgs boson, and I was in charge of explaining  the Higgs mechanism  and the “Mexican Hat”  shape of the Higgs field. This enhanced  my communication and teamwork  skills.</p>

<p>SKILLS</p>

<p>Languages       Gujarati (mother  tongue) English (fluent)
Programming     C++, R, Unix, Python
Software        Microsoft Office, Mathematica, WCSim, Geant4, ROOT, LATEX</p>

<p>Special  interests:   I built  a website that explains various physics topics, the address of which is: http://schrodingers-kitten.weebly.com/. I am a student member  of the IOP and regularly  attend events  held by them.</p>
